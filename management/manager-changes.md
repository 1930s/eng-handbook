# Engineering Manager Changes

This guide is meant to help you, as a manager, facilitate the transition of an engineer on your team to another team.

## tl;dr;

Terminology:
* Outgoing / Current Manager = Manager of the person who is switching teams
* Teammate = person switching teams, since this guide is written from the perspective of a manager
* Incoming / New Manager = The soon-to-be new manager for the person switching teams

If you've done this before or want a quick overview of the below, here are the rough steps to remember for a transition:
* Communicate directly: Make sure the outgoing/current manager and the person moving teams are the first to directly discuss the change and are on the same page.
* Develop a transition plan: Have a plan for how and when the transition should happen, and take time to catalogue any responsibilities that will shift owners.
* Communicate more broadly: Share with the team and organization as a whole, provide outlets for questions and feedback.
* Transition: Act as if the person has two managers for some period of time to ensure that things go smoothly.
* Finalize: Don't forget the paperwork.

## Communicate Directly

In general, the first two people that should confirm and discuss a team transition directly are the current manager and the person switching teams.

If you are the current manager, it's often the case that your teammate has already discussed the transition with other people, such as their friends or even the new receiving manager, but it's important to not consider it a done deal until the two of you have a direct and explicit conversation about the transition yourselves.  In the end, the two of you have the most context on what's going on with the team and what might make the most sense as a transition plan.

Some topics to cover:
* Why is your teammate interested in switching teams?
* How they did decide which team they were interested in switching to?
* Is there anything you can do or could've helped with in making this decision?

If you're the receiving/new manager, consider the above in the opposite direction. Don't confirm a team transition until the outgoing/current manager has done so with their teammate directly, make sure you know why they are interested in joining your team, etc.  

A good rule of thumb is to also make sure the two affected managers have either met or chatted directly about the transition.

## Develop a Transition Plan

*Have a shared understanding of what needs to be done to ensure a smooth transition off of the current team.  This involves working through the details both between the current and new manager, as well as between the current manager and their teammate.*

### Current Manager <=> Teammate

There's a lot more that goes into a transition than simply a manager or org change. You should work together to agree on what and how responsibilities should be transferred and on what timeframe. A transition plan is ideally shared and written (can just be an email), and should answer the following questions:
* **When is the transition happening?** This should take into account current projects in flight or other needs on either team. Note that transitions can also be planned far in advance, e.g. "transition will happen after <project X> is finished, which should be around <6 weeks> from now"
* **What was the person working on currently, and is there a new owner for each responsibility or project?** Helping the new owners ramp up on these responsibilities should be factored into the transition plan as well.
* **Does this transition plan and timing make sense to the new team?** This should just confirm that the timing (e.g. 6 weeks) makes sense to both sides, and there might be cases where you need to meet in the middle.  e.g. "transition will be in <2 weeks> so he/she can help with <new project Y>, but he/she will continue to wrap up <old project X> until it's finished and handed off to <old teammate>"

Here are some responsibilities to keep in mind for engineers:
* Run / oncall
* Code reviews
* Critical unterviews (especially for specialists e.g. ML/FE/Mobile)

### Current Manager <=> New Manager

In addition to working out a more project or work-based transition plan for your teammate, as a manager you should also put in time to ensure a smooth mentorship and career development transition as well.  Share and get as much context as you can on your teammate, and don't hesitate to continue asking questions as they come up, even after the transition or months later.

Some topics both managers should cover together:
* Overview of time on current team and potentially at the company so far: projects, team relationships, interests, etc.
* Career goals, both long-term and short-term
* Strengths and areas for development: share past performance reviews or written feedback
* Any other things learned from being this person's manager: preferred management style, 1-1 cadence, etc.

### Performance Reviews

One question that may come up is how you should share any past performance reviews. One suggestion is to sit down as a group (old manager, teammate, new manager) and walk through the previous review together.  In general, the expectation is that performance reviews should be shared to ensure continuity of feedback and development, but everyone should know that it's being shared and ideally it should be done together in-person. You can do this through a transition "1-1-1" meeting with all three of you together.

### Communicate More Broadly

*Communicate widely, in increasing waves corresponding to who would be most affected by the change first.*

With everyone (current manager, teammate, new manager) on the same page, and a transition plan in place, it's time to share this upcoming change with more people. It's up to you to decide what makes most sense since every team is different, but as a rule of thumb it makes sense to share in some order of most affected first, or those people who would be most surprised to find out late.

Potential sharing steps:
* Share with the immediate team first, either through 1:1s or in-person at your next team meeting.  The person changing teams should feel free to tell people themselves, of course.  Also, ensure that people feel like they can ask questions, just by offering it. (E.g. Including "feel free to ask me if you have any questions about this transition.")
* Share with partner teams, or just go for larger open communication (e.g. email lists)

In general, the current manager is the one who shares the news as in the example below, but you can tailor this to your own circumstances if needed. (E.g. current manager is no longer with the company, or out on parental leave, etc.)

### Transition!

*Ensure a smooth change by co-managing actively throughout the transition plan.*

With the change well-communicated and a transition potentially already underway, continue to support your teammate through the end of the plan. Any new relationship takes time to develop, so it's important for your teammate to feel supported by both the current and new managers, and to feel that they have an outlet to give feedback in either/any direction.  The amount of time you spend in this co-managing state depends on the situation, but a general suggestion would be to consider ~1 month of close-to-full co-management.

Example management timeline (in parallel to the work transition plan):
* The transitioning person should begin having 1:1s with both managers, with the expectation that they'll formally end with the current manager after <X weeks>, but that the current manager will always be around as a sounding board
* Their relationship doesn't have to end even if their org-official ones does
* There should be some feedback shared in all directionsâ€”current/new manager should check in to see how 1:1s are going, with each other and with their current/new teammate.
* This doesn't need to be formal, it's just good to remember to check in and ask, "Hey, how is it going with <new person>?"

### Finalize the Manager Change

*Make it org-official and take care of logistics.*

Logistics and organizational changes should always feel like just the dotting of I-s and crossing of T-s at the end of the process. Some of these things may have already happened as part of the transition plan (e.g. seating changes often happen early), but it's good to double-check and make sure these are handled.

Logistics:
* Transfer the person officially via HR/Payroll
* Update seating charts and internal profile accordingly
* Adjust any relevant oncall/run rotations or team groups and channels
