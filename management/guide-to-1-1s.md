# How-To Guide for 1:1s

Recurring one-on-one meetings (1:1s), are one of the ways in which people and their managers have dedicated and scheduled time set aside to discuss issues not just related to their day-to-day work. There's no one right way to approach 1:1s, so this guide contains some goals for them, tips and tricks, and potential ways to structure individual conversations. This guide is addressed to the manager, so "you" refers to the manager (and teammate to the person who "you" are the manager for).
 
## tl:dr;

Read the rest of this doc for more info on 1:1s in general, but if you're looking for a quick-start guide, try this:
* Schedule a weekly 30 minute 1:1 for you and your teammate
* Use some method to keep track of potential agenda items or things both of you would like to bring up each week—e.g. a shared google doc or personal notebook
* Follow a basic structure for each 1:1:, found below: Sample 1:1 Schedule

## Goals & Purpose

### What are manager 1:1s for?
* Building a relationship and rapport between you and your teammate
* Having dedicated time to talk about career development and career goals
* Giving and receiving feedback
* Addressing or raising concerns
* Helping your teammate work on the right things, by prioritizing or helping push back when needed
* Giving your teammate more and continued insight into the org and the company overall
* Showing commitment to helping your teammate find fulfillment and happiness in their job

### What are they NOT for?
* Project or day-to-day work updates
* Open-ended or undirected conversation

## Scheduling Tips: Timing and Cadence

The exact cadence and timing of a 1:1 varies widely by individual and circumstance, and it's reasonable and expected that you may not meet with each person on your team in the same way.

### Tips for Scheduling
* Have a recurring, explicit meeting invite setup for you and your teammate
* Make sure this time works well for both of you, and be open to moving it as needed

*You may want to create it so that both of you are in control of the time, and can move the meeting independently*

### Timing Choices
* 1 hour: this is considered the ~longest length for a 1:1, and may be used more commonly with less frequent meetings. (Note that it may be hard to make the full hour feel productive, so consider starting with a shorter timeslot and increasing if needed.)
* 45m: somewhere in between, often used to catch up initially with new team members
* 30m: this is the most common length for a 1:1, and also the minimum amount of time you may need to have a productive discussion; typically weekly

*A good rule of thumb is to start with 30m weekly, and adjust the timing as your relationship develops.*

As a manager, you should aim to meet with each of your teammates roughly every ~1-2 weeks.

If for some reason, you are meeting with them less frequently than biweekly, you should consider other ways to ensure they are getting the ongoing support they need. E.g. having other 1:1 support with mentors on their team, or being explicit about you helping in a transition time when they do not yet have dedicated managers.

## Making an Agenda

In order to have a productive conversation, it's important to come into the meeting with some ideas in mind for what you two should talk about.

This can be roughly categorized into (1) things you need to cover this week or right away, (2) things that you'd love to talk about soon but need not be right now, and (3) longer-term considerations and goals.

### (1) Things to cover now
* Are there things that urgently need addressing, or are blocking or relevant to work that's active or coming up soon?
* Anything on your teammate's mind goes here to start, and you can choose to followup on individual topics later if they're not urgent
* Has anything significant happened recently with the team or company that's relevant to them? E.g. a new team member or org change, upcoming org process like levels, etc.

### (2) Things to cover soon
* Are there things that you've carried over from previous conversations that should be resolved?
* Are there topics relevant to upcoming (but not immediate) work?
* Broader company/team/org changes that are happening soon

### (3) Longer-term considerations and goals
* How are you thinking about your teammate's longer-term career development and goals?
* Do you have any feedback that may help them improve or grow?
* Any thoughts on your team or company's longer-term goals and initiatives? Things they are excited about or unexcited about in general?

*Note that it's easy for these types of longer-term topics (3) to fall to the bottom of the priority list, so make sure to incorporate longer-term considerations into your **(1) Things to cover now** list on a regular basis.*

## Ideas for Note-Taking

How you choose to take or share notes is up to you, so here are just a few ways to approach this:

### Shared Online Document
*E.g. Google Doc: Shared with you / your teammate*

**Pros:**
* Easy for both of you to keep notes and track potential agenda items throughout the week
* Can be a helpful reference for past conversation topics or things/actions you've agreed to

**Cons:**
* May create an overly-structured script for the conversation and not leave room for "top of mind" concerns or topics
* Takes work to maintain over time

### Personal Notes
*E.g. Your handy pen and paper or cloud document of choice*

**Pros:**
* Easy for you to keep personal and private notes
* Can be a helpful personal reference for past conversation

**Cons:**
* One-sided record of what you've talked about (It's often very helpful to have things in writing/shared)

### No Notes
*If you choose not to take ongoing notes for your 1:1s, it can be very helpful to followup periodically with written actions via email or other forms of communication*

**Pros:**
* Easy to maintain
* Easier to have a more casual and informal environment – coffee or neighborhood chats

**Cons:**
* Easy to lose track of what you've talked about or want to talk about

## Sample 1:1 Schedule

There's no one right way to have a 1:1, so given the considerations above, here is just one suggested way to use your time:

**Warmup (first few mins)**: Casual chat, catchup on how things are going more generally

**Agenda (bulk of the meeting)**: If you do have a shared doc, use it as a reference here
* Cover topics you both have on your mind and came into the conversation with
* Things you've prepared and thought about beforehand
* Things your teammate brings up for topics they have been thinking about

**Other Topics (with remaining time)**: If you've covered your agenda and have extra time, use this time for longer-term topics or things that are less urgent but worth discussing
* How are things going on the team more generally? Both in terms of work being done, but also team relationships and productivity?
* How do you feel about the team's direction? How about Stripe's overall direction and trajectory?
* Any thoughts on recent company all hands, announcements, org /or process updates?
* How do you think project X went?
* Any continuation from discussions on personal or career goals and trajectory?

**Closing & Next Steps (final few mins)**: Summarize what you've discussed and capture what might need followup actions or a future conversation. If you do have a tracking doc or some personal tracking mechanism, these are the things you should record for next time
