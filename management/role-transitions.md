# Engineering Role Transitions (IC <> EM)

This guide is meant to help describe what happens when people in engineering transition between roles, as in between an individual contributor and manager role.

## tl;dr

In all scenarios, the most important thing is to communicate and set expectations with everyone involved. This means ensuring that anyone affected understands what is happening, when it's happening, and how their own responsibilities and relationships may change—all before making any changes official. The role of an Engineering Manager may differ depending on your company culture, so refer to your Engineering Manager and Engineering IC career ladders if available.

## Individual Contributor to Manager

### Why become a manager?

The main reasons someone may choose to transition into a manager role include:
* There's a clear need for a manager on the team
* They have already been successful with mentorship and technical leadership, and are interested in focusing more of their time on the development and support of people and teams
* They have a clear understanding of the expectations of the new role and are excited by them

### What are the steps to take?

*Let's assume Alice is considering transitioning into a management role, and her manager / the person facilitating the transition is Mary.*

If the above reasons hold true, here are some steps to follow:

#### Define the new role and associated responsibilities

Alice and Mary should work together to define the scope, membership, responsibilities and goals for the new team. Because manager roles are filled upon need, there should be a natural mission for this team that already exists, though it might be a specialization of an existing larger team that's splitting in two. This plan should include things like:

* Definition of team — purpose, goals, projects it will take on in the first 3-6 months
* Membership of team — who will be part of this team 

*A good rule of thumb for a new team is somewhere between 3 - 8 people, where < 3 feels like the scope is too limited to warrant a new team and > 8 is a tough challenge for a new manager.*

#### Get feedback from team members, peers, other engineering managers

As the facilitating manager, Mary should get feedback from people Alice has worked with or helped mentor and develop. This includes discussing a possible transition with other engineering managers, who are familiar with Alice's work and what the role entails.

In gathering feedback, Mary should also be explicit that this feedback is being gathered because we're considering a transition for Alice. E.g. "We've been talking about having Alice become a manager for team X working with Y, and I'd love to get your thoughts on this." This should ideally not come as a surprise, and it should be clear a manager is needed, and that Alice has already been playing a leadership role on the team.

* For all / in general: what are Alice's capabilities when it comes to technical leadership and technical ability?
* For people Alice has mentored: how were they as a mentor? what did you rely on them for and how did they help you grow?
* For peers / other teams: how did they help their projects or the team succeed?
* For other managers: how do you think they will tackle cross-org manager responsibilities?

A typical way this feedback gathering happens is by starting a discussion with a peer group of managers or fellow managers in your organization, explaining the potential transition plan and giving people an opportunity to share any thoughts or concerns.

#### Communicate the plan with the new team members

If the feedback comes back positive, the next step is to communicate the potential transition with the current members of the team, and in particular with the people whose manager will potentially be changing.  I.e. "As we discussed previously, we're considering transitioning Alice into a manager role on the team, where she'd be your new manager."  This is a good time to get any additional feedback that might come out of making this more explicit.

If there are clear blockers, that feedback should also be communicated to Alice directly. E.g. "I've been gathering feedback about the potential transition, and here are <XYZ> things I think we should focus on improving before we make the transition."

#### Setup an evaluation period (~4-6 weeks)

Mary, Alice, and the affected team members should agree on an evaluation/transition period that makes the following clear:

* Weekly 1-1s with the new manager, Alice, as if they are the new official manager
* Continued check-ins with the outgoing manager, Mary
* Transfer of information / context on each individual from Mary to Alice

If something comes up during the evaluation period that might block the transition, that feedback should again be shared with Alice.

#### If successful, complete the transition and communicate it more widely

If the evaluation period goes well and everyone is comfortable with the new role and manager, we can complete the transition.

* Mary confirms the transition with the team
* Mary can cancel or cut down recurring 1-1s with any moved team members
* HR-finalize the transition for each person (e.g. updating official manager information in people systems)
* Alice is added to company engineering manager groups and  meetings
* Alice will take over any performance reviews and will be able to read the most recent review for any of their new teammates
* Mary can announce the transition more broadly

In addition, once this is finalized, Alice will take on several additional responsibilities as a manager, including but not limited to:

* Understanding the company's people philosophy, including delivering performance reviews, level and compensation changes as they come up
* Being involved in the recruiting, hiring, spinning up new hires
* Anything else the Engineering Manager role entails for your company

### Checklist Version 

* Define new role and team, including charter and members
* Collect 360 feedback from teammates, peers and partners, other eng managers
* If feedback comes back with any blockers, stop transition. Otherwise, proceed.
* Setup 4-6 week transition period with "double management"
* Confirm and finalize the transition with each member of the team—in person in 1-1s, in team meeting, etc.
* Confirm and finalize with the broader engineering organization
* HR-finalize the transition for every affected person on the team
* Announce the change to the broader organization or company
* Attend any relevant new manager training programs
