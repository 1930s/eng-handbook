about: Suggest an idea for a new guide

**What's a short description for your requested guide?**
 A clear and concise description of what the guide would answer. E.g. I'd like to have a better way to document incidents, that capture the important information but don't take too long to write.

**What category do you think it falls under? See <a href="../blob/master/drafts/requests.md">requests</a> or <a href="../blob/master/README.md">live guides</a>**
E.g. Engineering Managment, Recruiting & Onboarding, Development Practices

**Additional context**
Add any other context that'd help in writing the new guide. E.g. external references, samples
